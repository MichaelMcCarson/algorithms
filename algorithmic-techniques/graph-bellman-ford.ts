// Explanation

// --------------------------------------------
// Graph Class
// --------------------------------------------

// Represents the graph using an adjacency list of edges.
// addEdge method adds a directed edge with a weight between two vertices.

// --------------------------------------------
// Bellman-Ford Algorithm
// --------------------------------------------

// Initialization: Set the distance to the start vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity.

// Edge Relaxation: For each edge, update the distance to the destination vertex if a shorter path is found. Repeat this process |V| - 1 times, where |V| is the number of vertices.

// Negative Cycle Detection: Check for negative weight cycles by attempting to relax the edges one more time. If a shorter path is found, a negative weight cycle exists, and the algorithm returns null.

// --------------------------------------------
// Time Complexity
// --------------------------------------------

// The Bellman-Ford algorithm runs in O(Vâ‹…E) time, where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
// It is less efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm for graphs with non-negative weights but is essential for graphs that may contain negative weights.

// --------------------------------------------
// Use Cases
// --------------------------------------------

// Network Routing: Finding the shortest path in networks where link weights can be negative due to various factors like delays.
// Finance: Detecting arbitrage opportunities in currency exchange.
// Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Modeling paths where certain paths might have negative effects (like tolls or restrictions).

// The Bellman - Ford algorithm is a powerful tool for shortest path problems, especially when negative weights are involved.
